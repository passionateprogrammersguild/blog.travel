On Tuesday, May 9, 2023 I had my last cataract surgery on my left eye.  I can now see distance pretty well but up close and midrange are a bit blurry.  I was amazed as I was driving yesterday how well I could see street signs that I could not see before with glasses.  When I was going through the procedure I could see what looked to be the inside of my eye.  I could see red stems that looked like plants from another planet as the surgeon was replacing the lens in my eye.  The surgery was around 2:45PM EST so needless to say I was pretty hungry following the procedure.  We ended up going to a place our neighbor recommened called Willy's Burger and Booze in St. Pete Beach as the prices are reasonable and the portaions are large.  I cant say we will go back, but it satisfied the immediate need.

This morning I met with a buddy of mine who told me what a terrible blogger I am, and he is right.  From today forward I am going to do my best to write a little something everyday.  We are looking forward to this Mothers day weekend.  Carols parents are coming into town.  We are taking them and Carols brother and his wife out to 82 degrees in St. Pete Beach on Saturday to celebrate Mothers day. Our frind Gregg has a friend coming into town so we are going out to celebrate with them this Saturday night.  Sunday will be a day of healing.
