It's hard to believe we have been in St. Pete Beach for about a week.  I would say that in this short time we have had many experiences which have been fuled by our desire to be intentional with our time and us making mistakes along the way.  It sounds silly to say but we have had memorable experiences every day we have been here.  What this makes me realize is how much I have been on auto-pilot before we started this journey.  I am so glad that Carol and I are doing this together.  Making memories, both positive and the preceived negative.

A quick summary of our adventures so far include

- Day 1 - The Great Departure, and the Painful Arrival
- Day 2 - The Family Visit
- Day 3 - The Dog Bar with Friends
- Day 4 - Surveying the Land
- Day 5 - The Journey to the other side
- Day 6 - Party like a gandma, and Jeep People

Each day has its own story which I plan on writing about soon, so stay tuned.  Today Carol and I are going to ride the <a href="https://www.psta.net/about-psta/projects/sunrunner/" target="_blank">SunRunner</a> which is currently free bus transportation from St. Pete Beach to what is affectionally referred to as the Burg (town).  We are going to spend our day on the SunRunner jumping off on stops that look interesting and exploring the area.  Wish us luck as we continue to explore the area and hepefully make friends along the way.
