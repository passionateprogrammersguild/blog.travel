In July of 2017 Carol and I sold our home of 14 years in Orange Park, FL and bought a condo on Jacksonville Beach in an iconic building with our daughter Sarah and our attention demanding hound Ginger. We lived ther for 5 years and in those 5 years our daughter moved out, and Ginger God bless her wonderful soul passed away, and the building we thought we would retire in was having some challenges. So here we are. We sold our condo on the beach and we are currently living with my in-laws who are the most wonderful people in the world. We leave tomorrow to start our traveling adventure in St. Pete Beach FL.

I feel that St. Pete Beach will be the easiest of our moves in that we have family and friends there. We will be there for 3 months and then we will be off to our next destination. With Carol and I both working remotely and with everything falling into place, now is the right time to do this. This was not a plan or even a thought in our minds that we would do something like this, but here we are, about to upend our lives and live what seems to be an adventure of a lifetime. I am sure it will have its stresses and challenges, but we are doing this together, and that is what I am most looking forward to.
